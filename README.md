# Reaction Roles
##### By TechnicPepijn#0995
Give users roles by letting them react to messages!

## How it works?


Use `==newrr` to start the setup!
You can choose 3 different reaction styles for your bot!


## What is comming?
Currently we are working to upgrade the bot to a new level, we like users be happy with the bot and not to be angry because those setups ARE SO ANNOYING. **NO!** We like to keep it simple so we are working on a web dashboard for users to create their reaction roles.

## What do we do?
This reaction roles bot does the following,
* Reaction Roles, give users roles when they react at a message
* Clear Channels, delete all messages posted in a given channel
* Embeds, generate embeds!
More to come later! Feel free to suggest features in our support server!

## Milestones
* `[7 may, 2020]` - Released bot
* `[21 august, 2020]` - Reached 200 servers
* `[26 November, 2020]` - Reached 500 servers

Hope to see you soon!
